# Golang Exercise

At AppsFlyer, we have many offices around the world, and our team loves to wear hoodies.
However, not all weather is hoodie appropriate.
If it is over 15Degrees Celcius, there is no need for a hoodie.

Create a small golang cli tool that recieves the name of a city where appsflyer has an office,
and tells us if we need a hoodie tomorrow.

Example:

    ❯ hoodieOrNoHoodie kiev                                                                                                         [17:21:52]
    hoodie
    
    ❯ hoodieOrNoHoodie rio                                                                                                         [17:21:52]
     no hoodie
