# Golang Exercise

At AppsFlyer, we have many offices around the world, and our team loves to wear hoodies.
However, not all weather is hoodie appropriate.
If it is over 15Degrees Celcius, there is no need for a hoodie.

Create a small golang cli tool that recieves the name of a city where appsflyer has an office,
and tells us if we need a hoodie tomorrow, or the day after, some other time in the near future.

Example:

    ❯ hoodieOrNoHoodie kiev                                                                                                           
    hoodie
    
    ❯ hoodieOrNoHoodie rio                                                                                                           
    no hoodie

Come to our booth and show us your code.
